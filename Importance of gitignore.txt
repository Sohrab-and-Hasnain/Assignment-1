The .gitignore is a text file where each line contains a pattern for files or directories to ignore. 
It is usually placed at the root of the project folder. Alternatively, you can put it in any folder in the repository and a project can have multiple .gitignore files.

This file lists files that are intentionally untracked and should be ignored by Git. 
It is important to note that changes to files that were staged before being added to the .gitignore file will continue to be tracked by Git. 
In other words, .gitignore will only ignore files in the working directory.

Having patterns like *.class, *.o, *.pyc in your .gitignore files allows you to ignore those files once and for all. 
Subsequent git status runs (or similar if you're using a GUI) will not tell you these are new, untracked files, thereby letting you focus on the files 
that are really new and noticeably untracked.
